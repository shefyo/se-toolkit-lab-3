# Lab 01 – Product architecture, tech roles, & your skills

Questions:

- Do you know what skills are needed to build software projects?
- Have you thought about which tech role you want to pursue as your career?

In this lab, you will explore three things:

1. How real software products may be structured;
2. What kind of engineers may build and operate them;
3. How your skills compare to market demands.

Along the way, you'll practice using `Git` and `GitHub` — essential tools for collaboration between developers.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

- Use `GitHub` to structure your work and collaborate with peers (issues, branches, pull requests, and reviews).
- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of components, data flow, deployment, and tech roles.
- Reflect on your career in tech, examine your current skillset, and plan for the future.

After this lab, you should be able to say:

> I can use `Git` and `GitHub`.
>
> I understand how software products can be structured.
>
> I know how I can grow as an IT specialist.

## Tasks overview

```console
□ Setup   — fork repo, find a partner
□ Task 0  — practice git workflow
□ Task 1  — analyze a product's architecture
□ Task 2  — map components to tech roles
□ Task 3  — compare your skills to market demands
```

In this lab, you'll simulate some of the real-life engineering practices:

- Communicate via issues/PRs;
- Check your work against acceptance criteria;
- Write clear commit messages.

### Pair work and TA

You'll work with a partner throughout this lab. You complete tasks individually, but review each other's work via pull requests.

As your proceed with the lab, show your progress to the TA.

## Tasks

### Setup (~30 min)

First complete the [lab setup](./lab/setup.md).

### Required tasks (~2 hours)

For all required tasks, you must follow the same [`Git workflow`](./lab/tasks/git-workflow.md).

1. [Practice the `Git workflow`](./lab/tasks/required/task-0.md#practice-the-git-workflow) (~15 min)
2. [Choose a product and study its architecture](./lab/tasks/required/task-1.md#choose-a-product-and-study-its-architecture) (~30 min)
3. [Study tech roles involved in the chosen product](./lab/tasks/required/task-2.md#study-tech-roles-involved-in-the-chosen-product) (~30 min)
4. [Compare your tech skills with the market needs](./lab/tasks/required/task-3.md#compare-your-tech-skills-with-the-market-needs) (~30 min)

### Optional tasks

Complete all optional tasks to leave up to 1 hour early (lab is 3 hours):

1. [Resolve a merge conflict](./lab/tasks/optional/task-1.md#resolve-a-merge-conflict).
2. [Add a CI check](./lab/tasks/optional/task-2.md#add-a-ci-check)
3. [Create a release](./lab/tasks/optional/task-3.md#create-a-release)
4. [Plan skill development](./lab/tasks/optional/task-4.md#plan-skill-development)
