## `GitHub flow`

`GitHub` flow is a process for organizing the work on a repository.
It can be used both by individual developers and teams.

See [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

## The `GitHub` site

The `GitHub` site has this [URL](./web-development.md#url): <https://github.com>.

## Repository

A repository (or "repo") is a storage location for files that are version-controlled using [`Git`](./git.md#what-is-git).

A `GitHub` repository contains not only your project files but also additional collaborative features such as [issues](#issue) for tracking bugs and tasks, [pull requests](#pull-request-pr) for code review and merging changes, and [Projects](#github-projects) for organizing work.

### Fork

A fork is a copy of an original project repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project repository.

When you fork a repository on `GitHub`, you create a personal copy under your `GitHub` account where you can make modifications, test features, and propose changes back to the original repository through [pull requests](#pull-request-pr).

### Fork a repo

1. Go to `GitHub`.
2. Go to the repo that you want to fork.
3. Click `Fork`.
   1. Click `Choose an owner`.
   2. Click `<your-username>` to make you the repo owner.
   3. Click `Create fork`.

## Create an issue

1. Go to [`GitHub`](#the-github-site).
2. Go to the repo where you want to create an issue.
3. Click `Issues`.

4. Click `New Issue`.
5. Click one of the suggested [issue forms](#issue-form).
6. In the `Add a title` input field, edit the title.
7. Fill out other input fields.
8. Click `Create`.

## Issue form

A repository owner can provide [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms) so that users can create issues in a given format.

Examples:

- `Lab Task` - [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml`](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml)
- `Bug Report` - [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml`](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml)

## `GitHub Projects`

<!-- TODO structure better and simplify -->

`GitHub Projects` is a project management tool integrated directly into `GitHub` that helps you plan, track, and manage your work. With `GitHub Projects`, you can create boards to organize [issues](#issue), [pull requests](#pull-request-pr), and notes in a customizable workflow.

Key features of `GitHub Projects` include:

- **Boards**: Visual Kanban-style boards to track work items across different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Automation**: Built-in automation rules to move items between columns based on status changes
- **Views**: Multiple view options including board, table, and roadmap views
- **Integration**: Direct integration with issues and pull requests in your repositories
- **Custom fields**: Ability to add custom fields to track additional information like priority, team, or estimates
- **Templates**: Pre-built templates for common workflows like Agile, Scrum, or basic task tracking

`GitHub Projects` can be scoped to a single repository or span multiple repositories, making it ideal for managing work across entire organizations or teams.

You can use Projects to plan sprints, track bug fixes, manage feature development, or coordinate any other collaborative work.
