# `Git workflow` for tasks

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure is based on the [`GitHub flow`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

## Create a `Lab Task` issue

[Create an issue](../appendix/github.md#create-an-issue) using the `Lab Task` [issue form](../appendix/github.md#issue-form).

## Switch to the `main` branch

Go to `VS Code`.

Switch to the `main` branch using any of the following methods:

- [Switch to the `main` branch using the `VS Code Terminal`](#switch-to-the-main-branch-using-the-vs-code-terminal)
- [Switch to the `main` branch using `GitLens`](#switch-to-the-main-branch-using-gitlens)

### Switch to the `main` branch using the `VS Code Terminal`

1. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   git switch main
   ```

### Switch to the `main` branch using `GitLens`

1. [Run using the `Command Palette`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-command-palette):
   `GitLens: Git Switch to..`.
2. Select the `main` branch (e.g., using `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` on your keyboard).
3. Press `Enter` to confirm.

## Pull changes from `origin/main`

Pull changes from the `main` branch in your fork on `GitHub`.

We call that branch `origin/main`.

### Pull changes from `origin/main` using the `VS Code Terminal`

1. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

   ```terminal
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Pull changes from `origin/main` using `GitLens`

1. [Run using the `Command Palette`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-command-palette): `GitLens: Pull`

## Resolve conflicts

You may see some errors and messages about conflicts after pulling.

It may happen that commits on your `origin/main` are different from commits on your local `main` branch in your cloned repo on your computer.

You can see that in the [`Status Bar`](../appendix/vs-code.md#status-bar).

<img alt="Commit Conflict" src="../images/appendix/vs-code/status-bar-commit-conflict.png" style="width:400px"></img>

You need to pull commits from `origin/main` into your local `main`.

These commits from `origin/main` will find a place somewhere among the commits on your local `main`.

However, you can get conflicts if commits from `origin/main` modified the same lines of text in files as your local commits but in a different way.

In this case, you should rebase your local branch and resolve conflicts:

- [Pull and rebase using `GitLens`](#pull-and-rebase-using-gitlens)
- [Resolve conflicts using `GitLens`](#resolve-conflicts-using-gitlens)

### Pull and rebase using `GitLens`

When you rebase, your local commits are placed on top of the commits from `origin/main`.

1. [Run using the `Command Palette`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-command-palette):
   `GitLens: Pull`
2. Select `Pull with Rebase` (e.g., using `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` on your keyboard).
3. Press `Enter` to confirm.
4. You're done if `GitLens` doesn't show any error.

### Resolve conflicts using `GitLens`

Continue resolving conflicts if you see an error like this:

<img alt="Pull Error" src="../images/appendix/gitlens/pull-error.png" style="width:400px"></img>

1. [Open the `Source Control`](../appendix/vs-code.md#open-the-source-control).
2. Go to `Merge Changes`.
3. Click a file.
4. Click `Resolve in Merge Editor`.
5. Accept changes that you like more.
6. Click `Complete Merge`.
7. [Open the `Source Control`](../appendix/vs-code.md#open-the-source-control).
8. Click `Continue`.
9. This should be resolved.
10. There may be other conflicts.
11. `VS Code` can show something like `Rebasing (1/3)` and `Cancel`.
12. Click that `Cancel`.
13. Repeat steps.

## Switch to a new branch

Create a new branch and switch to it using any of the following methods:

<!-- no toc -->
- [Switch to a new branch using `GitHub`](#switch-to-a-new-branch-using-github)
- [Switch to a new branch using the `VS Code Terminal`](#switch-to-a-new-branch-using-the-vs-code-terminal)
- [Switch to a new branch using `GitLens`](#switch-to-a-new-branch-using-gitlens)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace the `<branch-name>` with the actual branch name.

### Switch to a new branch using `GitHub`

1. Go to your fork on `GitHub`.
2. [Create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue).
3. Copy the command provided by `GitHub`. It's something like:

   ```terminal
   git fetch origin
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

4. [Run the copied command using the `VS Code Terminal`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal).

### Switch to a new branch using the `VS Code Terminal`

1. [Run using the `VS Code Terminal`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-vs-code-terminal):

    ```terminal
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

### Switch to a new branch using `GitLens`

1. [Run using the `Command Palette`](../appendix/vs-code.md#run-a-command-using-the-command-palette):
   `GitLens: Git Create Branch..`.
2. Select `main` as the base branch (e.g., using `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` on your keyboard).
3. Press `Enter` to confirm.
4. Write `<branch-name>` to provide the new branch name.
5. Press `Enter` to confirm.
6. `Select Create & Switch to Branch` (e.g., using `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` on your keyboard).
7. Press `Enter` to confirm.

## Edit files

Edit files in the [`Editor`](../appendix/vs-code.md#editor) to produce changes.

## Commit

[Commit changes](../appendix/git-vscode.md#commit-changes) to the `<branch-name>` to complete the task.

## (Optional) Undo commits

[Undo commits](../appendix/git-vscode.md#undo-commits) if necessary.

## Publish the branch

[Publish the branch](../appendix/git-vscode.md#publish-the-branch) with your changes.

## Push more commits

[Push more commits](../appendix/git-vscode.md#push-more-commits) to the published branch if necessary.

## Create a PR to `main` in your fork

[Create a PR](../appendix/github.md#create-a-pr) replacing:

- `<repo-owner-username>` with `inno-se-toolkit`;
- `<repo-name>` with `se-toolkit-lab-2`;
- `<your-username>` with your `GitHub` username;
- `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch that you want to merge in the PR.

## Get a PR review

[Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) a review of the PR from the collaborator (see [PR review rules](#pr-review-rules)).
